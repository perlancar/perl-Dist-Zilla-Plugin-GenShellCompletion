Revision history for Dist-Zilla-Plugin-GenShellCompletion

0.07    2014-12-18 (PERLANCAR)

	- [Bugfix] apparently we need to register prereq Perl::osnames for
	  phase configure, not build.


0.06    2014-12-18 (PERLANCAR)

	- Skip non-POSIX OS for now (ref:
	  https://github.com/perlancar/perl-Complete-Util/pull/1).


0.05    2014-12-13 (PERLANCAR)

	- Forgot to add --replace option to shcompgen during install phase.


0.04    2014-12-13 (PERLANCAR)

	- Rename module/dist from DZP-Rinci-InstallCompletion to
          DZP-GenShellCompletion because this plugin is actually not
          Rinci-specific.

        - Replace the use of bash-completion-prog with shcompgen (which supports
          multiple shells and make it possible to activate completion in the
          current shell instead of waiting to start a new shell).


0.03    2014-11-13 (PERLANCAR)

	- Increase perl minver to 5.10.1 [CT].


0.02    2014-11-09 (PERLANCAR)

	- Skip adding code to Makefile.PL if there are no scripts/execfiles
	  in the dist.

	- Revise doc (mention Getopt::Long::Complete,
	  DZP::GenBashCompletion::GetoptLong).


0.01     2014-11-08 (PERLANCAR)

         - First release.
