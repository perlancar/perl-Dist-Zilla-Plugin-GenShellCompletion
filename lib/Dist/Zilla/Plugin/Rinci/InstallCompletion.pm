# ABSTRACT: Install bash completion for scripts when distribution is installed

=for Pod::Coverage setup_installer

=head1 SYNOPSIS

In your dist.ini:

 [Rinci::InstallCompletion]


=head1 DESCRIPTION

This plugin modifies C<Makefile.PL> so that when a user installs your
distribution with C<make install>, L<bash-completion-prog> is invoked to add
C<complete> bash command for your scripts. This is convenient because at the
next shell the user starts, bash tab completion is already activated for your
scripts.

L<bash-completion-prog> recognizes several ways/hints to add completion to your
scripts. Please see its documentation for more details.

Some notes:

First, user must already install and setup L<bash-completion-progs> (included in
L<App::BashCompletionProg> distribution). But if App::BashCompletionProg is
installed after your distribution is installed, she can simply run
C<bash-completion-prog> to scan PATH and add completion for all recognized
scripts, including yours.

Second, this plugin's implementation strategy is currently as follow (probably
hackish): insert some code in the generated C<Makefile.PL> after
C<WriteMakefile()> to insert some targets in the C<Makefile> generated by
C<Makefile.PL>.

Third, currently only MakeMaker is supported, L<Module::Build> is not.


=head1 SEE ALSO

L<App::BashCompletionProg>

CLI scripts using the L<Perinci::CmdLine> framework will automatically have bash
completion capability. L<bash-completion-prog> detects this.

You can also use L<Getopt::Long::Complete>.

Or, if your CLI scripts use L<Getopt::Long>, you can use
L<Dist::Zilla::Plugin::GenBashCompletion::GetoptLong> to produce a completion
script based on the spec passed in Getopt::Long::GetOptions.
